<h1>Appcasting</h1>
<p>
Appcasting is a mechanism for software delivery. Appcasting is based on the same concept as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasting</a> and was first described (to our knowledge) by <a href="http://www.speirs.org/appcasting/">Frasier Speirs</a>.
</p>
<p>
DamageControl supports Appcasting through built-in RSS feeds. In order to use Appcasting you need an &lt;enclosure&gt; aware RSS reader such as <a href="">NetNewsWire</a>.

<p>
By subscribing to the RSS feed of a project your &lt;enclosure&gt; aware RSS reader will ask you if you want to download build artifacts as they become available.
