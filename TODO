These are important TODOs that must be fixed before release and RubyConf.

== General stuff ==
* Fix SQLite concurrency problems
* Get DC to work with lighttpd (too damn slow with WEBRick). script/lighttpd
  Problems:
    * lighttpd often dies on http://localhost:8000/project/list
    * if it doesn't die, I get:
      NameError in Project#list
      uninitialized constant Project
      /app/controllers/application.rb:70:in `load_projects' 
    * see application.rb. I tried some require_dependency, but it doesn't help
    * this NameError also occurs sometimes with WEBrick
* Move doco under public/doc so that a stable web server can serve it even when DC is down
* Avoid NameError with WEBrick that occur randomly (see above)
* Make sure DC runs on Windows/Linux (people are going to be disappointed if the release only works on os x)
* Make DC run against PostgreSQL (MySQL is not popular at Codehaus)

== UI stuff ==
* Fix diff logic so diffs can be shown in web
* Integrate scm_web and tracker with XForge (lots of stuff moved here)
* Fix the project overview to the right
* Fix settings bug that unsets SCM if saved w/o clicking SCM
* Align build/revision content to the top
* Use a proper 3-col layout
* General ui CSS niceness (logo and professional looking layout can wait)
