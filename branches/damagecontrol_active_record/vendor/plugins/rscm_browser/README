== RSCM Browser ==

RSCM Browser is a Ruby on Rails plugin that adds a browser interface to your rails app.

=== Installation ===

First, you must put the rscm_browser directory under your app's vendor/plugin directory.
If your project is under Subversion, you can use svn:externals to do this (TODO: describe how)
Otherwise, you can just copy the file structure manually.

Second, you must add the following line to your config/environment.rb file so that Rails can
find the RSCM Browser controller:

  config.controller_paths << File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'vendor', 'plugins', 'rscm_browser', 'controllers')
