<h1>DamageControl architecture</h1>
<p>
  DamageControl consists of several sub systems, each running in a different ruby process:
</p>
<ul>    
    <li>
        The SCMPoller polls SCMs for new revisions and persists
        them to DamageControl's internal database. Whenever the SCMPoller detects 
        a new revision, it will create a new build request for the associated project.
        
        Each project can be configured with different SCM polling strategies:
        * Always (default)
        * One-off (used with scm triggering)
        * Never (used for disabled projects)
        * Time based (nightly builds)
        
        These strategies can be combined...
    </li>
    <li>
        Builder. BuildExecutors look in the database for new build requests.
        Build requests are created by SCMPollers, but may also be created via the
        web interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        SCMIndexer. This process updates a search index with the contents of each
        project's SCM. The index is used by DamageControl's integrated search engine.
    </li>
    <li>
        The webapp.
    </li>
</ul>
