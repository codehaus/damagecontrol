SUMMARY

Ruby Gnuplot is a pipe-based interface to the ever popular gnuplot
(www.gnuplot.org) package. Through this interface every capability of gnuplot
is useable from within Ruby. The design of this software was very much
inspired by the Python Gnuplot effort that is currently being worked on by
Michael Haggerty.

The goals of this package are as follows (in order of my priorities):

1. Provide a general object oriented interface for scientific plotting that
completely hides the details of the underlying implementation. ie. The fact
that this uses gnuplot should be hidden from the user.

2. Provide sufficient documentation so that this software is useable and
extendable by other individuals in the scientific community.
      
3. Work with the Python Gnuplot community to maintain consistency between the
implementations as much as possible. </ol>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to that Michael Haggerty for his initial implementation of the
Python Gnuplot wrapper that this draws from heavily. His software is very well
documented and designed and is a joy to work with.
