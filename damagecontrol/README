= DamageControl - a cross platform continuous integration server.

= Feature overview

* Supports all SCMs supported by RSCM.
* Web interface based on RoR (http://www.rubyonrails.org/)
* Colourised HTML diffs.
* RSS feeds for changesets and builds.
* Generation of URL links to diffs for several popular SCM web front-ends.
* Generation of URL links to bugs/issues for several popular bug/issue trackers.
* Uses UTC times according to the SCM server's clock, not the machine running RSCM. No NTP needed!

== DamageControl Server

DamageControl ships with a web app based on Ruby On Rails (which you currently have to install separately). To launch:

  ruby script/server
  
You also need to launch (in a separate console) the DamageControl daemon process:

  ruby -Ilib lib/damagecontrol/server.rb
  
The daemon process is the core of DamageContriol that performs SCM access and executes builds. The web app communicates with this process over Drb to display results. 

The reason why two processes are needed is due to the fact that Dir.chdir may happen in various threads,
which would confuse the webapp if they ran in the same Ruby process. We tried with forking, but this is not 
supported on Windows. We may support a fork-based one-process alternative for Linux/Cygwin in the future.

Once the two servers are started, you can access the web app on:

  http://localhost:4712/

== Colourised HTML diffs

The web interface will present changesets as colourised diffs. Even for SCMs you never thought would support
that kind of feature. (As long as there is an RSCM plugin for it).

== RSS Support

The DamageControl daemon can generate RSS feeds for all supported SCMs. The RSS feeds will have one item per changeset.
Each RSS item's description contains the changeset's commit message, optionally with HTML links to
issue/bug tracker issues (if detected in the changeset's commit message). The item's description
will also contain a list of all the modified files, optionally with HTML links to a diff page
in an SCM web front-end.

== Supported Issue trackers

DamageControl can recognise bug/issue numbers (in commit messages) for a number of popular issue 
tracking systems. It converts the SCM commit message to HTML with links to the issues mentioned in the commit message.

== SCM web front-ends - diffs

DamageControl's web interface features colourised diffs for all changes in a changeset.
It can also generate links to individual diff pages in other SCM web frontends:

* RSCM Built-in HTML diffs.
* Fisheye - http://www.cenqua.com/fisheye/
* ViewCVS - http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/

Planned:

* Trac - http://www.edgewall.com/trac/
* Chora - http://horde.org/chora/
