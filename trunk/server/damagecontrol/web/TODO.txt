TODO:

o Include SCM images in distro for firewalled installations.
o TW logo and link to homepage.
o display windows/unix icon according to path

o Trigger settings:
  - xmlrpc: nothing more to specify, since the server should know.
  - socket: reenable, but with xmlrpc like protocol
  - email: email address, pop server, user and pass
  - polling: poll interval (minutes)
  
o build command settings:
  - ant/maven/generic (show icon)
  - ant/maven: relative path to clover. enable clover coverage monitoring if specified.
  - ant/maven: parse output for test count/duration
  - ant/maven: goals/targets (full ant/maven command line)

o general help in popups a la confluence
o on save, always update trigger. try to uninstall/install.

o Help text:
  - Project name: Used to identify this project. Will be used in links and reports
  - Build command: What kind of build to run. Specifying Ant/Maven will enable some extra diagnostics such as test metrics.
      Note that DC will execute this command from the root folder of DC's working copy of the project indicated by SCM settings.
      Link to environment variables doc page.
      
      This can be a good way to specify additional params such as ftp passwords
      
  - Tagging: BUILD_${DAMAGECONTROL_LABEL}
      
  - Unix groups: (Only if DC or the SCM is running on a unix box). The groups DC must be a member of in order to build. In addition to this you may have to talk to your local unix admin.
      The reason this must be specified is that on some unix systems group permissions must be explicitly set for new shells
      (using newgrp) in case the system user DC is running as is member of more groups than the OS supports. On Linux this is
      usually 32. Setting this value should solve this problem.
  - Source control: where the project's source code is stored.
  - Nudge mechanism: How DC will be nudged to build your project.
  - Nag email: where DC should send email when build fail
  - email-on-success: whether DC should send email upon success.
  - tagging
  - IRC channel:
  - Yahoo!
  - Jabber
  - SMS
  - JIRA ID/URL/user/pass (DC will create issue and assign to 1st violating user. Not recommended in conj. with email+jira-email as this is too much noise)
  - All of these sensitive settings SHOULD be hidden for people w/o access to any of the unix groups. (chgrp/chmod on project.conf by DC)

o User settings:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Yahoo!
  - Jabber
  - Tel
  - Mob
