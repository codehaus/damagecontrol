The DamageControl Team (Jon Tirsen and Aslak Hellesoy) are proud to release DamageControl 0.2 prerelease (this prerelease is for Windows only).

<a href="http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/">http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/</a>

DamageControl is a Continuous Integration server with the follwoing main features:

<ul>
<li> Simple configuration. No XML. All web based configuration.
<li> Supports building of Java/Ant/Ruby/.NET/C++/Cobol/whatever - DamageControl is platform agnostic.
<li> Self contained - comes with its own web server and Ruby runtime. (DamageControl is written in Ruby).
<li> Support for as many projects as your RAM and disks allow. In one single server.
<li> Multi channel notification on build results. (Email, IRC, built-in Web pages, DCTray - windows system tray)
<li> Supports parallel builds.
<li> Builds are trigged by the SCM (CVS) upon commits. DamageControl can install SCM triggers automatically.
<li> Pluggable API for cool extensions
<li> Integration with <a href="http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/">ViewCVS</a> and <a href="http://www.cenqua.com/fisheye/">Fisheye</a>
</ul>

You can look at a live deployment here: <a href="http://builds.codehaus.org/public/dashboard">http://builds.codehaus.org/public/dashboard</a> (Yes, DamageControl runs on Linux too)

N.B! Due to a misconfiguration of the Apache proxy on Codehaus, this doesn't work with IE yet. Use a real browser like Firfox or Opera.

<li> Perforce suport.
<li> Support for poll based builds (in addition to trigged builds)
<li> Better layout (once we grok div and css properly).
<li> RPM packages for linux
<li> More notification channels (RSS, Yahoo! messenger, Jabber, Eclipse plugin, IDEA plugin, Apple dock)
</ul>
