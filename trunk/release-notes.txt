The DamageControl Team (Jon Tirsen and Aslak Hellesoy) are proud to release DamageControl 0.2 prerelease (this prerelease is for Windows only).

http://damagecontrol.codehaus.org/

DamageControl is a Continuous Integration server with the follwoing main features:

o Simple configuration. No XML. All web based configuration.
o Supports building of Java/Ant/Ruby/.NET/C++/Cobol/whatever - DamageControl is platform agnostic.
o Self contained - comes with its own web server and Ruby runtime. (DamageControl is written in Ruby).
o Support for as many projects as your RAM and disks allow. In one single server.
o Multi channel notification on build results. (Email, IRC, built-in Web pages, DCTray - windows system tray)
o Supports parallel builds.
o Builds are trigged by the SCM (CVS) upon commits. DamageControl can install SCM triggers automatically.

You can look at a live deployment here: http://builds.codehaus.org/public/dashboard (Yes, DamageControl runs on Linux too)
If you want to add a project, go here: http://builds.codehaus.org/private/dashboard (ask Jon or Aslak for username/password)
N.B! Due to a misconfiguration of the Apache proxy on Codehaus, this doesn't work with IE yet. Use a real browser like Firfox or Opera.
You can also monitor these Codehaus DamageControl server's activity on irc://irc.codehaus.org/damagecontrol

Things that didn't go into this release, but will go into one of the upcoming releases:

o Subversion support (nearly there!).
o Perforce suport.
o Support for poll based builds (in addition to trigged builds)
o Better layout (once we grok div and css properly).
o RPM packages for linux
o More notification channels (RSS, Yahoo! messenger, Jabber, Eclipse plugin, IDEA plugin, Apple dock)
