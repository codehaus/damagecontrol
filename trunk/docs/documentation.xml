    <title>What is DamageControl</title>

    <para>DamageControl is a continous integration system that helps you to
    keep feedback about build failures. If you are working on a project that
    is supervised by DamageControl and one of your team members commits
    changes to the Software Configuration Management System, DamageControl
    will detect the changes to the codebase and attempt to build a integration
    build of your project.</para>

    <para>If this integration build succeeds, everything is OK. The green
    light shows up and you can continue your work. If the recent changes have
    broken the build, your project is damaged. DamageControl helps you to
    <quote>control the damage before the damage controls you</quote>. The
    first step is that the team members who have broken the build are
    informed. There are different ways to do it, they can receive an EMail, an
    instant message, an issue could be filed in the issue tracker or a status
    monitor at their desktop could show a red light.</para>

    <para>In the next step, the objected changes could be rolled back, so that
    the project is in an consistant state again. The damager will repair the
    damage and everyone else will continue to work.</para>

    <para>What distinguishes DamageControl from other continuous integration
    systems like CruiseControl or CruiseControl.NET?</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl is under heavy development. If you want to use
        something rock solid and do not care for the newest features, stop
        reading here.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl is platform agnostic. You can build your project
        with Java, Ant, Ruby, .NET, Nant, Make or whatever tools you
        like.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl is easy to use and offers simple, web-based
        configuration. No need to edit XML files.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl is self-contained. It comes with an own runtime
        and an embedded webserver.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl has many channels to notify users of successful or
        failed builds. And it is very easy to create your own notification
        channel.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl supports as many projects as you need and your
        build server can handle. It is even possible to run multiple builds at
        once.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl builds are triggered by CVS or Subversion on every
        commit. It can install the triggers for you and supports polling, if
        it is impossible to use triggers.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DamageControl integrates with tools like ViewCVS or Fisheye as
        well as Jira, Bugzilla and Scarab.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In this documentation you will find everything needed for running
    and configuring DamageControl. Additionally you will find information
    important if you would like to implement extensions to DamageControl to
    make it fit your specific needs.</para>

    <para>Before you decide that you do not need a program like DamageControl,
    because it does not help you to create more shiny new code in shorter
    time, consider the advantages of detecting problems early: The sooner a
    problem is detected, the cheaper it is to fix it.</para>

    <para>If you identify problems during requirements engineering, you can
    talk with the customer and the problem is gone. If you identify problems
    during the design phase, you have all opportunities to find a design that
    will avoid those problems. If you occur problems during the
    implementation, you can still fix bugs and create workarounds for other
    issues. Trying to correct a problem in an already deployed system is very
    hard and expensive.</para>

    <para>So DamageControl helps you to identify problems early, to solve
    identified problems and to produce high-quality-software cost-efficient
    while keeping your schedules.</para>

        <para>To install DamageControl on a server with an UNIX-like operating
        system, follow these steps.</para>

        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para>Download Ruby, version 1.8.2_pre2 or later from the <ulink
            url="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby Homepage</ulink>. In most
            cases it is not required to install Ruby manually, as most Linux
            distributions have prepared packages of Ruby available, which can
            be installed using the distribution's packet manager.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Install a client for the SCM system you are using on the
            build server. Supported version control systems are
            currently:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para><ulink

                Versioning System</ulink> (<abbrev>CVS</abbrev>)</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Download DamageControl from the <ulink
            url="http://dist.codehaus.org/damagecontrol/distributions/">DamagControl
            download page</ulink>. There is one distribution tarball for every
            successful build and in most cases the latets build is the best
            choice.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Unpack the tarball to a directory of your choice. Define a
            environment variable <envar>DAMAGECONTROL_HOME</envar> which
            points to the directory where you unpacked the archive.</para>
          </step>
        </procedure>

        <para>Additionally it could be useful to install an Apache Web Server
        to allow configuration of access privileges, a Mail server to send
        notification messages per EMail, or an IRC server.</para>

        <para>If you are using mail notifications, the optimal way to inform
        your developers is using a mailing list. Everyone who is subscribed to
        the mailing list will receive the notification, but DamageControl can
        still send mails to individual developers.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Gentoo Linux</title>

          <para>Users of Gentoo Linux can take advantage of a ebuild that wil
          automatically install DamageControl. Follow these instructions to
          install the ebuild.</para>

          <procedure>
            <step>
              <para>Open the file <filename>/etc/make.conf</filename> and
              define the variable <varname>PORTDIR_OVERLAY</varname>. This
              variable contains a list of directories portage uses to search
              for ebuild.</para>
            </step>

            <step>
              <para>Change to one of the directories defined before.</para>
            </step>

            <step>
              <para>Download the ebuilds.</para>

          <para>DamageControl can be installed by typing <literal>emerge
          damagecontrol</literal> on the command line. If you would like to

        <para>Users of the Microsoft Windows Operating System can install
        DamageControl using the installer. You do not need to download a

    <section>
      <title>Configuring the DamageControl Server</title>

      <para>Users of DamageControl under Microsoft Windows can start
      DamageControl using the created entries in the Start menu. On other
      platforms, starting
      <filename><envar>DAMAGECONTROL_HOME</envar>/bin/damagecontrol</filename>
      is the preferred solution. This script expects a configuration file as
      command line argument.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>It is very dangerous to run DamageControl as
        <literal>root</literal>-user. It is better to create a new user, which
        has read and write access to <envar>DAMAGECONTROL_HOME</envar> and
        <envar>DAMAGECONTROL_WORK</envar>, but cannot access other user's
        files.</para>
      </caution>

      <para>A default configuration is provided in the file
      <filename><envar>DAMAGECONTROL_HOME</envar>/bin/server.rb</filename>. If
      you would like to make changes to the configuration, you should create a
      copy of <filename>server.rb</filename> and edit and use this
      configuration file.</para>

      <para>The following sections cover example configurations for a number
      of purposes. All these configurations are optional and not needed if you
      just want to test DamageControl.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Access Control</title>

        <para>By default everyone can access the DamageControl server and add
        projects or change configurations. This is not useful if you want to
        have an public build server, because you do not want to allow
        strangers to change the configuration of your DamageControl
        server.</para>

        <para>This configuration involves two steps. Firstly you have to
        configure DamageControl to allow connections only from the local
        machine. Secondly you have to create a Apache proxy server that will
        serve the DamageControl pages.</para>

        <para>To modify the DamageControl configuration follow these
        steps.</para>

        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para>Open your DamageControl server configuration file in a text
            editor.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Find the section which configures the network server. This
            section looks in the default configuration like this:</para>

            <programlisting>server = DamageControlServer.new(
  :RootDir =&gt; ENV["DAMAGECONTROL_WORK"],
  :HttpPort =&gt; 4712,
  :PollingInterval =&gt; 60 # specified in seconds
  # to allow access only from localhost then uncomment line below 
  # (when running behind an Apache proxy for example)
  #:AllowIPs =&gt; [ "127.0.0.1" ],
  )</programlisting>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Change the lines to this configuration to allow access only
            from the local machine. If your webserver is running on a
            different machine, you should replace <literal>127.0.0.1</literal>
            with the IP-address of the remote webserver.</para>

            <programlisting>server = DamageControlServer.new(
  :RootDir =&gt; ENV["DAMAGECONTROL_WORK"],
  :HttpPort =&gt; 4712,
  :PollingInterval =&gt; 60,
  :AllowIPs =&gt; [ "127.0.0.1" ]
  )</programlisting>
          </step>
        </procedure>

        <para>In order to serve the DamageControl pages from an ordinary web
        server, install a web server and configure it to work as a proxy for
        DamageControl. An example configuration for the Apache webserver is
        like this.</para>

        <programlisting>ProxyRequests off
RewriteEngine On
ProxyPass /public http://localhost:4712/public
ProxyPassReverse /public http://localhost:4712/public
ProxyPass /private http://localhost:4712/private
ProxyPassReverse /private http://localhost:4712/private</programlisting>

        <para>This configuration passes all requests to
        http://servername/public and http://servername/private to the
        corresponding locations of the DamageControl server. To add
        authentification to the private configuration parts, you should append
        following lines to the Apache configuration.</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;Location /private&gt;
        AuthName "DamageControl"
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/dc.passwd
        Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>No user will be able to access the web configuration interface
        of the DamageControl server, unless the user has provided a
        username-password-configuration that is included in the password file
        <filename>/etc/apache2/dc.passwd</filename>.</para>
      </section>

      <section id="section.multiplebuildexecutors">
        <title>Multiple Build Executors</title>

        <para>DamageControl has the ability to run multiple build parallel.
        Each build will be executed by one build executor. The default
        configuration includes only one build executor, so if this executor is
        in use and a new build is triggered, the build will queued in the
        build queue.</para>

        <para>If you would like to build two projects at once, you have to
        define a new build executor. To do this, follow these steps.</para>

        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para>Open your DamageControl server configuration file in a text
            editor.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Find the line</para>

            <programlisting>def server.init_build_executors</programlisting>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Insert following code behind this line.</para>

            <programlisting>build_scheduler.add_executor(
  BuildExecutor.new(
    'executor2', 
    hub, 
    project_directories, 
    build_history_repository))</programlisting>

            <para><literal>executor2</literal> is the name of the new
            executor. This name must be unique for one DamageControl server
            installation.</para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>For each additional build executor, repeat the last step but
            do not forget to select a unique name for each executor.</para>
          </step>
        </procedure>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Configuring DamageControl Projects</title>

      <para>If you have installed DamageControl and set up DamageControl to
      fit your needs, it is time to configure projects DamageControl will
      build. This is very easy as you can use the web interface for almost all
      tasks.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Creating Projects</title>

        <para>In order to create a new project, open the private dashboard of
        the DamageControl server. If DamageControl is running on your local
        machine, the URL is usually <ulink
        url="http://localhost:4712/private/dashboard">http://localhost:4712/private/dashboard</ulink>,
        if DamageControl is running behind an Apache proxy, open <ulink
        url="http://hostname/private/dashboard">http://hostname/private/dashboard</ulink>.</para>

              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
        </figure>

        <para>After having entered all configuration options, you can click
        the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button and the new project is
        created.</para>

        <para>You can navigate to the project overview using the
        <guilabel>Back to project</guilabel> hyperlink or the hyperlinked
        project name in the navigation breadcrumbs. From this location, which
        is generally available at
        <literal>http://hostname:port/private/project/<replaceable>projectname</replaceable></literal>.
        This page allows you to clone the project, which will create a project
        with identical settings, but different name, to configure the project,
        to trigger a new build, even if no changes have been made to the
        codebase and to clean all working files.</para>

        <para>On the public project page, which is available at
        <literal>http://hostname:port/public/project/<replaceable>projectname</replaceable></literal>
        you can just view the current build status, inspect the command line
        output of the build or view unit test results. Aditionally it is
        possible to view the working files and the history of occurred
        builds.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>DamageControl and Build Tools</title>

        <para>DamageControl will support any build tool you need in your
        project. All you need to do is to enter the relevant build command in
        the field labeled <guilabel>Build command</guilabel>. If the command
        returns an exit code of <literal>0</literal>, the build is successful,
        if the build end with another status code, it was a failed
        build.</para>

        <sidebar>
          <title>What if the build returns the wrong error code?</title>

          <para>Some configurations of Ant under Microsoft Windows operating
          systems return the wrong error code. To fix this behaviour, you will
          have to modify the <filename>ant.bat</filename> that is executed
          when calling <command>ant</command> to return the correct error
          code. This is done by adding following code at the end of
          <filename>ant.bat</filename>.</para>

          <programlisting>exit %errorlevel%</programlisting>
        </sidebar>

        <para>Example commands to be run by DamageControl are:</para>

        <screen>make all
ant dist
maven jar</screen>

        <para>Some Windows setups may require, that you run ant in the native
        shell and not in a possibly installed cywin shell. For this purpose,
        you have to use a build command like this.</para>

        <screen>cmd /C ant dist</screen>

        <para>If your project root directory does not equal the project, you
        want to run your builds in, you have to change to this directory
        before. An appropiate build command would be as following.</para>

        <screen>cd subdir &amp;&amp; make all</screen>

        <para>If you need to build more complicated build scripts, you can use
        following environment variables that are passed to an external build
        process. You can use these variables to create build artifacts which
        are specific to a certain build.</para>

        <title>DamageControl and SCM Systems</title>

        <para>DamageControl has an event-view to your project. This means,
        rebuilds are triggered when a change to the codebase of your project
        (an event) occurs. To make this triggering possible, your software
        configuration management system must support triggers.</para>

        <para>For <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> systems like <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> and
        Subversion, DamageControl can install triggers automatically if it has
        local access to the repository. To use a specific
        <abbrev>SCM</abbrev>, you will have to select the radio box for this
        <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> and enter the required configuration
        parameters.</para>

        <para>If you have local access to the repository, there will be a new
        action available at the private project webpage, which allows you to
        create the repository and to install the triggers. If you are less
        fortunate, you will have to install the triggers yourself, which is
        described in the following sections.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Installing Triggers for <abbrev>CVS</abbrev></title>

          <para>To install the triggers for <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> you need to
          have DamageControl installed at the <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> server.
          DamageControl does not need to be running, as it will be used as
          client to trigger new builds via the remote
          <acronym>API</acronym>.</para>

          <para>To install the trigger follow these steps from a computer that
          has access to the <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> repository.</para>

        <title>DamageControl and Issue Trackers</title>

        <para>DamageControl has support for various issue trackers. In most
        cases this support means that whenever a commit message refers to a
        issue number in Jira, Bugzilla, Scarab or sourceforge.net issue
        trackers, this issue number will be turned into a hyperlink to the
        issue tracking system.</para>

        <para>For the issue tracker Jira, there is an additional feature. A
        Jira publisher allows to create Jira issues for each failed build. To

        os="windows">RSSBandit,</phrase> <phrase os="linux">Straw</phrase> or

            <question>
              <para>How does DamageControl detect a failed build?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>DamageControl has absolutely no knowledge of what the
              build command it executes actually does. It just launches the
              command you tell it to launch. (Could be notepad.exe or gimp for
              that matter - try it!). Since the build command is an arbitrary
              command, there might not even be any (system err/system out)
              output from it, so DamageControl doesn't try to parse that
              output. (Although it pipes it to a log file which you can browse
              to from the web admin).</para>

              <para>What DamageControl does is quite old fashioned (yet a
              well-established paradigm, at least in <acronym>UNIX</acronym>
              land): It looks at the return code from the build command. If
              it's 0 it is OK, otherwise it is KO. In short this means that
              your build command (whatever it is) must make sure to return a
              non-0 return code in the event of a build failure. Ant, Maven
              and Make do that.</para>

              <para>If you are writing a your build script in shell-script or
              some other scripting languages like Python and Ruby you need to
              make sure you are exiting with a non-zero exit code on build
              failure. Have a look at ant.bat to see how to do it from a .bat
              script.</para>

              <para>For example, the DamageControl build scripts (written in
              ruby and which of course are built in DamageControl itself) have
              code that looks something like this:</para>

              <programlisting>def fail(message = $?.to_s)
  puts "BUILD FAILED: #{message}"
  exit!(1) # &lt;------ non-zero exit code, build failed!
end

def run(args)
  begin
    # … snip, run the build ...
  rescue Exception =&gt; e
    fail(e.message)
  end
  puts "BUILD SUCCESSFUL"
  # exits with exit code zero
end</programlisting>

              <para>Under <abbrev>UNIX</abbrev>, the exit status of a shell
              script is the same as the last command run, which is generally
              what you want.</para>

              <para>Under Windows, you may have to add <literal>exit
              errorlevel</literal> to the end of your batch file.</para>

            <answer>
              <para>Say you have a project named myproject and you want to for
              example perform the deployment phase in a different build stage
              than the initial one. There is currently no explicit support for
              this in DamageControl but it's relatively easy to accomplish
              anyway using a trick:</para>

            <question>
              <para>How do I pin certain builds to certain executors?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>DamageControl has the ability (see <ulink
              url="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/DC-240">DC-240</ulink>) to
              have builds 'pinned' to certain executors. This means that each
              build can control which executors will, or won't, be allowed to
              execute it.</para>

              <formalpara>
                <title> Why would I want to pin a build?</title>

                <para>Well there's a number of ways this would be useful, but
                for example in our scenario we have 8 or 9 functional test
                builds that <emphasis>must</emphasis> be run in serial (ie
                FTest A, FTest B, FTest C etc). The advantage to having
                multiple executors allows us to reduce the average time for
                each build. However if the problem is that if we have a set of
                serial builds like this we can no longer have multiple
                executors because we can't guarantee they won't start to
                parallel each other. Pinning all these builds to a single
                executor means that they will run in serial, but won't block
                the entire build queue.</para>
              </formalpara>

              <formalpara>
                <title> So how do I pin a build?</title>

                <para>It's not documented anywhere (hence why I'm writing this
                <acronym>FAQ</acronym>) but it really is quite simple. To pin
                a build, you need to edit it's <filename>conf.yaml</filename>
                file (usually located in
                <filename><envar>DCHOME</envar>/work/<replaceable>pprojectname</replaceable></filename>)
                and add the following line:</para>
              </formalpara>

              <programlisting>executor_selector: <replaceable>FunctionalTests</replaceable></programlisting>

              <para>This will pin the current build to only the
              <quote>FunctionalTests</quote> build executor. The
              <parameter>executor_selector</parameter> property is a regular
              expression that must match the executor name. The default value
              is <literal>\.*</literal> - hence the default is to match all
              executors.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Development Environment</title>

      <para>Development of DamageControl requires the Ruby runtime, a CVS
      client and some developer packages like <command>crypt</command>. If you
      are workon on a <abbrev>UNIX</abbrev>- or Linux-machine, you can install
      the programs via the operating system's package manager. Users of
      Microsoft Windows should install cygwin.</para>

      <para>If you would like to create installers for Microsoft Windows, you
      should install the <ulink url="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">Nullsoft
      Scriptable Installation System</ulink>. It is possible to run
      <command>makensis</command> on Linux, if you compile it yourself or
      install <abbrev>NSIS</abbrev> under Wine.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Getting the Source</title>

        contains the source code for the various DamageControl client
        programs.</para>

        <para>Developers use different connection settings to access the
        DamageControl <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> repository. You will have to use
        <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> via <abbrev>SSH</abbrev>, which should be no

        <acronym>API</acronym> that allows developers to create various
        clients for DamageControl.</para>

        <para>Some operations of the <acronym>API</acronym> should be open for
        all. This includes all operations that do not modify any state on the
        DamageControl system, but merely provide querying functionality. These
        operations are part of the public API and marked with the modifier
        keyword <literal>public</literal> in the following synopes. The
        endpoint for the public <acronym>API</acronym> is
        <literal>http://host:port/public/xmlrpc</literal>.</para>

        <para>Other operations should be restricted to administrators or
        project developers. These are operations that modify the DamageControl
        system's state or execute builds on the server. The endpoint for this

      <title>SCM Extensions</title>

      <para>This is a guide for people who want to write a new SCM plugin for
      DamageControl.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>DamageControl relies on the RubySCM<footnote>
            <para>Ruby SCMM is an API that has been factored out of
            DamageControl's core).</para>
          </footnote> API for interaction with underlying SCMs.</para>

        <para>The first step in adding support for a new SCM is to write a
        Ruby SCM class. To prove compliance with the RubySCM API we have
        written a test suite that you can use. If your class passes that test
        suite, you can be pretty sure your SCM class is good enough for
        DamageControl and we will happily add it to the codebase.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Writing a test class that uses RubySCMs test suite</title>

        <programlisting><remark>TODO</remark></programlisting>

        <para>And a skeleton of your SCM class</para>

        <programlisting><remark>TODO</remark></programlisting>

        <para>Try to run the test:</para>

        <screen><prompt># </prompt><userinput>ruby -Iserver <replaceable>server/rubyscm/MookyTest</replaceable></userinput></screen>

        <para>This will probably fail, and it is time to fix the first error -
        implement the <methodname>create</methodname> method.</para>

        <programlisting>def initialize(mooky_dir)
  @mooky_dir = mooky_dir
end

def create(&amp;line_proc)
  cmd(@mooky_dir, "mooky create", &amp;line_proc)
end</programlisting>

        <para>Run the test again. Assuming your code is correct, you should
        now get a different error, which should lead you to implement the next
        method. Just continue like this until all tests are passing.</para>

        <para>If your SCM's command line interface writes output that needs to
        be parsed, we recommend you to implement the parsing logic in a
        separate class. That will allow you to test the parser without running
        the command.</para>

        <title>Web Interface</title>

        <para>If you write your own <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> plugin you would
        probably also want the DamageControl web admin to display it as a
        supported <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> in the project configuration pages.
        Every <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> has its own set of values that needs to be
        specified in order to check out code.</para>

        <para>To enable your <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> to be configured from the
        web you need to implement something we call an
        <classname>SCMWebConfigurator</classname>. See <ulink
        url="http://cvs.damagecontrol.codehaus.org/damagecontrol/server/damagecontrol/scm/CVSWebConfigurator.rb?view=auto">CVSWebConfigurator</ulink>
        for an example on how to implement one.</para>

        <para>Basically you need to create an erb file for the part of the
        form that is the <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> configuration. This will be
        included into configure.erb. You can also define JavaScript code that
        will be included in the top of the same page and you can execute
        JavaScript code on the onLoad event. The details of all this should
        become quite apparent by reading the code for the above mentioned
        <classname>CVSWebConfigurator</classname>.</para>

        <para>To inform the DamageControl server about your new
        <abbrev>SCM</abbrev> you edit
        <varname>DamageControlServer.scm_configurator_classes</varname> in
        <filename>DamageControlServer.rb</filename>. You can also override
        this method in your own server configuration if you like.</para>

      <section>
        <title>How to contribute</title>

        <para>If you contribute all of this with unit tests (see the
        SVNTest.rb and SVNLogParserTest.rb for inspiration) you will earn lots
        of DamageControl points. If you know how to write working code, but
        not how to write unit tests, we'd of course be happy to accept your
        contribution regardless.</para>

        <note>
          <title>If you do not know Ruby</title>

          <para>f all of this is too big a task for you you can still
          contribute. The DaamageControl development team doesn't have acces
          to every single SCM out there. But we'd be able to implement this
          for you if you help us out with some extra information such
          as:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para> What are the command line commands for executing
              checkouts, updates and getting (history) logs?</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para> What does the output of the log command typically look
              like?</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para> Please contact us on

          information.</para>

      <qandaset>
        <qandadiv>
          <qandaentry>
            <question>
              <para>Why do I get a weird error from REXML?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>Sometimes you get an error like this:</para>

              <screen><computeroutput>1) Error:
test_successful_build_data(DamageControl::CruiseControlLogParserTest):
NameError: undefined local variable or method `num' for REXML::Encoding:Module
    c:/ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/rexml/encodings/ISO-8859-1.rb:13
    c:/ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/rexml/encoding.rb:29:in `load'

    c:/ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/rexml/source.rb:41:in `encoding='
    c:/ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/rexml/parsers/baseparser.rb:183:in `pull'
    c:/ruby/lib/ruby/1.8/rexml/parsers/pullparser.rb:45:in `pull'
    ./damagecontrol/cruisecontrol/CruiseControlLogParser.rb:40:in `parse_top_level'
    ./damagecontrol/cruisecontrol/CruiseControlLogParser.rb:27:in `parse'
    ./damagecontrol/cruisecontrol/CruiseControlLogParser.rb:25:in `open'
    ./damagecontrol/cruisecontrol/CruiseControlLogParser.rb:25:in `parse'
    damagecontrol/cruisecontrol/CruiseControlLogParserTest.rb:14:in `test_successful_build_data'</computeroutput></screen>

              <para>This is because the REXML distributed with certain
              versions of Ruby is pretty crappy. So DamageControl includes its
              own REXML version but in order to have the included version
              override the version distributed with Ruby you need to specify
              the switch <quote><literal>-I<replaceable>&lt;damagecontrol
              home&gt;</replaceable>/server</literal></quote> (or
              <quote><literal>-I.</literal></quote> if you are in that
              directory) when starting the test-suite or the server.</para>

              <para>So instead of: </para>

              <screen><prompt># </prompt><userinput>ruby damagecontrol/AllTests.rb # will not work!</userinput></screen>

              <para> then do:</para>

              <programlisting><prompt># </prompt><userinput>ruby -I. damagecontrol/AllTests.rb</userinput></programlisting>
            </answer>
          </qandaentry>

          <qandaentry>
            <question>
              <para>Why do I get weird problems with libraries?</para>
            </question>

            <answer>
              <para>This could be because you have specified a relative path
              in the library path (<literal>'.'</literal> for example, as in
              <literal>ruby -I. script.rb</literal>) and have changed the
              working directory somewhere in the script. There are basically
              one workaround and one solution to this problem, the workaround
              is simply to specify an absolute path instead of the relative
              path. The solution is to use the
              <methodname>with_working_dir</methodname> method (in the
              <classname>FileUtils</classname> module) instead of changing the
              directory with <methodname>Dir.chdir</methodname>, the
              <methodname>with_working_dir</methodname> restores the previous
              working directory before it exits. Like this:</para>

              <programlisting>require 'damagecontrol/util/FileUtils'
include FileUtils

with_working_dir("somedirectory") do
  # … trut your stuff ...
end</programlisting>
