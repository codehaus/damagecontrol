<h1>Architecture</h1>
This document explains the architecture of DamageControl.<br>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<h3>Build</h3>
A Build represents the process of executing a build. It has one method
called execute() that will do essentially two things:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Get the latest sources from the SCM</li>
  <li>Execute a build command that will result in the generation of
compulsory build artifacts. The build command may also result in
generation of secondary build artifacts and perform deployment
operations.</li>
</ol>
If any of these operations fail, the build will be marked as failed.<br>
<br>
A lifecycle object goes through the following lifecycle:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Prepared (Constructed)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Getting sources (may fail or succeed)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Executing (may fail or succeed)</li>
  <li>Analyzing (may fail or succeed)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Completed</li>
</ol>
TODO: STATE DIAGRAM<br>
<h5>Prepared<br>
</h5>
This is the initial state that the object will be in after its
creation. At this stage it should contain sufficient internal
information to carry out steps 2,3 and 4.<br>
<br>
At the preparation state it is possible to set information that can
also be discovered during the Analyzing state. This information is
typically:<br>
<ul>
  <li>files that were changed since last attempted build</li>
  <li>people who checked in code since last attempted build</li>
</ul>
Whether or not to record this information during the prepared state or
the analyzing state is configurable. Depending on the SCM and build
system in use, one or the other may be more appropriate.<br>
<h5>Getting latest sources</h5>
The build is in this state from the moment an SCM update to the local
build machine starts until it is finished.<br>
<h5>Executing</h5>
While the build command (which will be run as a separate process) is
still running, the build is in executing state. If the process itself
fails, the build will be marked as failed, marking it with the error
message from the operating system.<br>
<br>
The standard output/error streams from the build command will be
intercepted by DamageControl and written to two different log files.<br>
<br>
If the process completes, the decision whether the build failed or not
will be deferred until the Analyzing state.<br>
<h5>Analyzing</h5>
If the build process terminated normally, the status of the build will
now be determined. This can be done in a combination of the following
ways:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Analyse the system out and system error log files produced during
the Executing state.</li>
  <li>Analyse additional log files produced by the build system.</li>
</ul>
The process log files and build system log files are likely to contain
redundant (but hopefully not contradictory) information. How they are
analysed and combined is up to individual build analyser objects. This
is configured during the setup of the DamageControl launcher script.<br>
<br>
The relevant information from the Analyzing state (such as whether the
build failed, why it failed, how long the execution of the tests took
etc.) will be set on the build object. This information should not take
excessive amounts of memory (log files can be several megabytes).<br>
<br>
The build object will then be passed on to publishers that will publish
the result of the build to various communication channels<br>
