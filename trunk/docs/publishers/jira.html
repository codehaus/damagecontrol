<h1>JIRAPublisher</h1>
The JIRAPublisher component creates a new JIRA issue whenever a build
fails. The new issue will be assigned to the person responsible for
breaking the build. (If DamageControl can't figure out who broke the
build, it will pick the first person in the set of committers as
asignee).<br>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
JIRA 1.4 or later installed somewhere, with Jelly support enabled. See
the JIRA documentation for details.<br>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<h2>JIRA Configuration</h2>
You should create a separate JIRA user for DamageControl. This will be
the "reporter" user for new JIRA issues when a build fails.<br>
It is recommended that the JIRA user is called "damagecontrol" and that
the email be set to that of one of the DamageControl administrators.<br>
<br>
The damagecontrol JIRA user must also be granted privileges to create
new issues for all JIRA projects that wish to let the JIRAPublisher
post new issues for a particular project.<br>
<h2>DamageControl Server Configuration</h2>
Make sure you add the following line to the DamageControl server
startup script:<br>
<br>
# The root URL of the JIRA installation<br>
jira_url = "http://jira.codehaus.org/"<br>
JIRAPublisher.new(@hub, ShortTextTemplate.new, jira_host).start<br>
<h2>Individual project configuration</h2>
The project specific JIRA information should go into the DamageControl
configuration file (someproject-damagecontrol.conf). Example:<br>
<br>
jira_project_key: DC<br>
