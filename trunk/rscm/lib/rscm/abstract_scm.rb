  # This class defines the RSCM API. The documentation of the various methods
  # uses CVS' terminology.
  #
  # Some of the methods in this API use +from_identifier+ and +to_identifier+.
  # These identifiers can be either a UTC Time (according to the SCM's clock)
  # or a String representing a label (according to the SCM's label system).
  #
  # If +from_identifier+ or +to_identifier+ are +nil+ they respectively represent
  # epoch or the infinite future.
  #
  # Most of the methods take a mandatory +checkout_dir+ - even if this may seem
  # unnecessary. The reason is that some SCMs require a working copy to be checked
  # out in order to perform certain operations. In order to develop portable code,
  # you should always pass in a non +nil+ value for +checkout_dir+.
